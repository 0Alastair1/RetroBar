Pining for simpler times? RetroBar teleports you back in time by replacing your modern Windows taskbar with the classic Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, or XP style.

RetroBar is based on the [ManagedShell](https://github.com/cairoshell/ManagedShell) library for maximum compatibility and performance.

## Features
- Replaces default Windows taskbar with classic layout
- Native notification area
- Native task list with UWP app support
- Start button opens modern start menu
- Ability to show or hide the clock
- Theme support
- Several themes included:
  - System
  - Windows 95-98
  - Windows Me
  - Windows 2000
  - Windows XP (Blue and Classic)

## Custom themes
RetroBar supports custom themes. To use custom themes, create a `Themes` directory in the same directory as `RetroBar.exe`, and place valid `.xaml` theme files there.

Themes use the XAML `ResourceDictionary` format. [View the included example themes](https://github.com/dremin/RetroBar/tree/master/RetroBar/Themes) to get started.
